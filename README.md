To compile the application, open RoommateHub.xcworkspace (white file) and click the play button slight left of the
center of the top bar. You may either choose to run it on a simulator or install it on your iPhone. If installing on your
iPhone for the first time, you will need to verify RoommateHub (Settings > General  > Profiles & Device Management)
locally. If using the simulator, know that the constraints were optimized for the iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11, and iPhone
11 Max. 

The app will initially render the login page, where existing users can sign in. New users can click into the signup page,
where they will need to enter their information. Make sure to click outside of the textfields to get the keyboard to
disappear. Also note that passwords must be at least 6 characters in length and that both a first and last name is
provided. Upon a successful user registration, the Create User button will disappear. From there, return to the login
page and enter your new credentials to sign into RoommateHub. 

Immediately, you will be directed to the home page, with your name and room number displayed front and center. The
home page will render 3 buttons: Roommates, Task List, and Message Board. 

Tapping into Roommates will direct you to a list of all the other roommates who registered under the same room.
Clicking into each one will allow you to view their profiles. Additionally, you can send them an iMessage or SMS
message from within the app, though this does not work on the computer simulator since it does not have caller ID. 

Tapping into Task List will take you â€¦

Tapping into Message Board will display a list of anonymous messages. If you click the compose button on the top
right, you will be prompted to enter something yourself. Feel free to exit out and cancel your post by pressing the back
button on the top left. Contrarily, pressing the Submit Message button right below the text field will publish the
message to the board. However, messages are not editable afterwards so make sure you are satisfied with what you
write before submitting. 

And as always, you can log out in the home page by pressing the Log Out button on the top right.
